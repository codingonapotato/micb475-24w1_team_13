# Agenda

- Discuss datasets extracted from sent list of papers to teaching team

# Notes

- Most papers reviewed by Dr.Sun and Sam unfortunately weren't of sufficient quality for the project 
    - 3 usable datasets extracted but somewhat small. Discussed possibility of combining them for more data points to analyze
    - Metadata category in alcohol dataset may need to be converted from categorical -> numerical type
    - Read paper to see what is "low" vs "high" alcohol concentration or visualize dataset with histogram to find the natural split
    - Remove redundant metadata categories (e.g.) Metadata category where cell value is constant for the entire column
    - Keep continuous column but group them in a separate column
    - Use smokers as different categories
    - Group grams-per-day (reclassify as low/med/high)
- Potential questions based on available datasets:
    1. Is the oral microbiome impacted by both alcohol and smoking?
    2. (Variation of 1) Combine dataset to investigate more impact on gut or oral microbiome?
    3. Look at smoking status, see if their microbiome is more affected by alcohol 
- Ideally should start data wrangling soon before proposal but this can be flexible and rubric can be updated by teaching team to reflect to guide our proposal writing
- Decided to keep looking for papers but keep alcohol dataset as a backup (will be uploaded to server)
    > **Caution** | Make sure that papers use *16S Amplicon Sequences* and not *Metagenomic*. Cannot use the latter for our project
    - Potentially can look for 16S specific search engine/database for projects 
        1. ENA (European Nucleotide Archive)
        2. NCBI (SRA)
    - Send papers to Dr.Sun + Sam by Sunday evening. Will discuss during Monday meeting
