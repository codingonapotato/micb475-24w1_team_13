# Overview of Progress
- What has been done since Thursday's meeting:
  - Confirmed our research question
  - Worked on and submitted the proposal

# Agenda

- Any concerns or feedback about our approach or proposed timeline?
- Expand on what sort of statistical analyses we need to answer our aims and overarching research question
- Any tips for the project moving forward?

# Notes

- Add differential abundance analysis step for A1
- Use histogram to help bin our BDI score into low, med , high groups
  - Try following Moe's histogram
  - If stats requires more samples for other groups, adjust scales
     - Worst case we justify this as due to lack of sample size to derive something statistically significant
- Interesting to do PCoA and include ppl with low BDI score no anti, ppl with low with anti, and ppl with high BDI w/o anti, and ppl with high BDI w/ anti to see whether ppl taking anti to see if closer to low or high and see difference in microbiome between ppl whos treatments are working vs. those whose are not
  - Adjust A3 wording to include the high BDI no anti to analysis
  > Do we have to normalize additionally based on BDI score group (currently normalized only based on antidepressant use metadata category)
  - Could aggregate those 2 metadata categories into a new one that we can use to filter on both
- Could talk about more in-vitro downstream validation for stuff in our manuscript (e.g.) Seeing if there are negative markers in the gut
- Could replace core microbiome w/ indicator species analysis. Main thing is to get a list/table of indicator species
- Can see which stats to do once we get a good idea of what the sample distribution looks like 
- Deferring discussion of stats to next meeting to give chance for everyone to explore all stats options for this project
- Next thing on the horizon would be the oral presentation
  - 10 minute presentation w/ slides to whole class (Presenting other ppls research. Need to prep them)
  - In-person
- Can use R markdown script
