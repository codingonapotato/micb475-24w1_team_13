# Agenda
- What has been done this past week:
	- Met as a team and discussed which dataset to use (PD vs Alcohol)
	- We were concerned about the novelty of the aims we decided on last Monday's meeting. After reading through the alcohol paper in more detail, we realized many of those aims were addressed already (directly or indirectly) in the paper. 
	- Therefore, during our meeting we confirmed our dataset (PD) and main aims, which were also discussed with Dr. Sun during office hours:
		- A1: Compare gut microbiome between individuals with or without antidepressant use
		  - All on control, not on PD
		- A2: Compare gut microbiome between different BDI depression scores
			- All on control, combined antidep use
		- A3: Compare gut microbiome between different BDI depression scores
			- All on control, compare antidepressant use groups
	- Started proposal and delegated tasks
