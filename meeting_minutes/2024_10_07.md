# Agenda

- Discuss as a group potentially research questions with the depression + virus dataset
- Discuss as a group whether to move forward with this dataset or our fallback alcohol dataset + research question

# Notes

- Discussion on missing infectious status metadata column which appears to be in the list of available metadata but does not exist in the spreadsheet
    - Classify as depression vs not depressed if cannot resolve infection status
    - Could ignore and use entire dataset as a whole since typical depression studies wouldn't be screening for health status for participants anyways but should mention in methodology
- Could subset dataset based on assumption that no data for `regiment == non infected`
- Look into what drugs they used and try to resolve what `*d_drugs` column is referring to
- Discussion on potential question fo the HIV depression dataset
    - How does anti-depressant use affect the microbiome 
- Discussion on our backup question with the alcohol dataset
    - Look at smoking status, see if their microbiome is more affected by alcohol
        > Double-check whether Dr.Sun uploaded the alcohol dataset
    - Looking at effects to microbiome with different types of alcohol to see which is better for alocholic
    - Looking at gut microbiome would require us to merge datasets
    - Moving forward focusing on oral microbiome
- Look for paper to find reference for "good" oral microbiome

> Avoid comparing case and control which is what the primary source did
- Proposal Discussion
    - A1: General alcohol-use (different levels of alcohol-use on microbiome)
    - A2: How different drink types affect oral microbiome (holisistic)
    - A3: How does smoking-habit affect microbiome
    - A3 (alt): Which type of alcohol is highly associated with oral disease
