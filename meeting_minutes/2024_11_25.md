# Agenda
1. Discuss alpha/beta analysis figures
2. Discuss Indicator Species Analysis results
    - uncultured_organisms/unresolved taxonomy codes 
3. Discuss Ancom results
4. Discuss workload for final project presentation (Due Dec 2, 23:59)

# Questions 
1. What is the rule of thumb for QC when making our phyloseq object (e.g. removing ASV's with count < 5 or samples with < 100 reads)
    - Depends on the size of dataset, since ours is small, we don't need to
    - Rarefied dataset ONLY for diversity metrics, not for anything else
        - Re-rarify when recreating alpha/beta diversity in R
3. Warning messages while creating PCoA plots and performing PERMANOVA - unsure if these impact anything
4. Various questions regarding ANCOM

# Meeting Notes
### Discussion
- Weighted Unifrac emperor plot: low + yes seems to cluster somewhat but non-significant stats
- ANCOM results
    - Look into Desulfovibrionaceae in the literature: what is it involved in?
    - Bifidobacteriaceae all close to 0
    - Do stats on them (Wilcoxon) to see if they're significantly different
    - Seeing minute differences
- In Parkinson's patients
    - Might be that Parkinson's is masking any other changes and effects
- Narrative
    - Binned the depression scores
    - So far, none of those factors seem to impact any of the groups
- Zoom meeting on Thursday at 3:30pm with Dr. Sun and Sam, get action items done before then
### Figures
- Elipses on PCoA plots
- Stats in figure legend
- Hold off on ANCOM, see what DESeq says
- Will discuss more during Thursday's meeting
### Action Items Before Thursday's Meeting
1. Perform Core Microbiome (Venn Diagram) on combined groups, antidepressant use, and on BDI groups
    - Could be that drugs are more effective in high depression than low depression
2. Perform DESeq on combined groups but all pairwise comparisons
    - Filter for each combination
    - Tabulate (reference, which ones decreased abundance, increased abundance)
3. Indicator Species
    - 13 indicators, all associated with high depression
    - Repeat it for antidepressant yes/no, as well as for combination 4 groups (antidep/dep)
- Consider the significance and role of certain bacteria in the disease and antidepressant use
    - e.g. the ones highlighted in ANCOM and indicator species
- Look at numbers
    - Create tables (how many up/down), export as .csv
