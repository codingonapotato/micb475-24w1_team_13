# Agenda
- Discuss figures to include in the paper
# Notes
### Main figures for the paper
#### Figure 1: alpha and beta diversity 
  - Alpha diversity as panel A (richness_plot_C (Observed and Shannon on combined))
  - Beta diversity as panel B (weighted unifrac)
    - Add ellipses, even if they overlap (80%)
    - Mention in figure legend that it was set to 0.8

#### Figure 2: core microbiome (combined_venn_diagram)
  - Combined is interesting 
    - 15% shared across all groups
    - high/no = more unique profile, which would’ve been what we expected
    - Relabel the columns, besides that it looks good 
      - Can do on powerpoint (do a nice looking labels)
  - Cross reference with ISA, then pick out interesting taxa and look at literature
    - If don’t show up in ISA
      - ISA considers how abundant it is as well, which determines if it’s an indicator
      - If shows up in ISA as well, not only a predictor but also completely unique to that condition

#### Table 1: DESeq summary table
  - No acronyms

#### Figure 3: atdp and bdi DESeq
  - Panel A: atdp
  - Panel B: BDI 
  - See which ones have the same taxa
  - Colour code the bars
  - Remove NA, fix labels/titles (make reference point same as table)

#### Table 2: Indicator taxa
  - Make into nice table but only keep ones unique to a single category
  - Set threshold to 0.5 or higher
    - Be explicit about this (not ideal threshold) 
  - Can comment on them as being indicator
    - But mention in limitations of using lower threshold
  - Quite a few for high no, might be worth mentioning
  - May not be worth showing in presentation 
    - Unless highlight and speak on those 

#### Supplemental Figure 1 S1: HN vs HY DESeq

#### Supplemental Figure 2 S2: ANCOM (7 panels, genus level)

#### Additional notes:
- Check ANCOM at genus level
  - If interesting, include in figures
  - Only interesting figure right now is desulfovirbionacae (family level)
- General results so far: can see some depletion of certain taxa with high bdi, but antidepressant use restores microbiome a bit
- Have draft of presentation ready by Monday so they can give feedback during meeting 
    - Can also have some figures ready for feedback
    - Think about why we didn’t see expected differences
