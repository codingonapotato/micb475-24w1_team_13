# Agenda
1. Review draft proposal revisions so far
2. Question on alpha/beta diversity analyses:
        - Do we need to justify why we for example choose something like only considering phylogenetic distance or abundance/evenness?
        - Could we generate all the metrics and then compare & contrast results?
3. Progress update on aims

# Notes
- Do all the alpha analyses (maybe beta analyses?)
- Ancom (R Package) as an alternative for DESeq
- Remove the medium BDI group (only have extremes)
- Could do all the diversity metrics through R as well
- Qiime2 (up to refrac) needs to be done on that (upload .qzv + .qza files to GitHub)
