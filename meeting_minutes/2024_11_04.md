# Agenda
1. Review draft proposal revisions so far
2. Question on alpha/beta diversity analyses:
        - Do we need to justify why we for example choose something like only considering phylogenetic distance or abundance/evenness?
        - Could we generate all the metrics and then compare & contrast results?
3. Progress update on aims
