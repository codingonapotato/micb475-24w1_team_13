# Agenda
- Discuss any changes to presentation slides
- Discuss narrative of our manuscript
  
# Notes 
### Presentation Slides
#### Title
- Should be conclusion of what we found
  - "Antidepressant use may restore anti-inflammatory bacteria reduced by depression in Parkinson's patients" instead
- Have a slide that tabulates our combinations so others can understand more easily
#### Introduction
- Must talk about cohort
- Take out aims
- Order:
  1. Relevance of the topic/impact
  2. Research question/hypothesis
  3. Dataset overview: cohort info and size
  4. How we filtered and categorized the data
     - Make the categories into a table
#### Alpha/beta
-  Show either alpha or beta diversity
#### Core Microbiome
- Put numbers in the slide
- Title is good!
- Can try to see if any of the genera are shared with DESeq for the manuscript
  - Will help complement the discussion
#### DESeq
- Table slide
    - Separate the slides so it's easier to digest
      - Animation for high/lo and yes/no, another HY/HN so it's not too much to take in at a time
      - Calculate total for each row
        - Highest effect for high/low BDI
      - Just show the 3 rows we're talking about
- Plots
  - Don't discuss contradiction in presentation, just in manuscript
  - Change title to include "reverse abundance"
    - Be more direct
  - Animations
    - For anti-inflammatory
    - Then for pro-inflammatory
  - In manuscript, can mention how bacteroides was annotated that way in the dataset (might differ taxonomically further down)
#### Conclusion
- Change title
- Go through each comparison made
  - Doesn't have to be concrete
    - May not happen at community level (alpha/beta) but happens at taxonomic level
  - Alpha/beta: non-significant
  - Core microbiome: restoration
  - DESeq: restoration/reversal of certain genera
#### Limitations and Future Directions
- Do table, column for each
- What would you do if you could recollect the data?
#### Overall
- More visuals where possible
- 100 word limit in speaker notes per slide
